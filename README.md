# Flatiron Module 1 Data Science Project
 
## Overview

This project is the first solo Data Science project assigned for Flatiron School's Data Science program.  [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/campuses/chicago) is a professional bootcamp school with multipile curriculum served from numerous offices worldwide.

## Background

After completing 2 intense weeks of Python training (including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib), students were tasked with their first solo project.  It should be noted that this initial project is presented prior to any formal statistics training, and should be viewed as a training exercise.  All data and recommendations herein are fabrications.  Each company's tradmarks are their own and used for education purposes only.  Any misuse or misrepresentation of tradmarks or copyrights is completely unintential.

## Project Secifics

Students were given several sets of unclean data.  The assignment was to **clean** the data, **combine** it, and **analyze** any patterns to determine any relevancy of data.

## Deliverables

1. At least 3 questions/recommendations good business case?
2. New GitHub [repository](https://github.com/KelliExMachina/mod_1_movie)
3. README.MD
4. Presentation deck, 8 slides for 5 min presentation for non-tech audience with some tech people present.
5. [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with technical description for tech people
6. [Blog post](https://medium.com/@kelliexmachina) 
7. Live presentation
8. At least 4 meaningful visualizations 

## The Problem

### Should Microsoft enter the original content movie market?
 
#### Questions for consideration:
 
>1. What is the relationshipe of cost to gross receipts?
>  * Effects of genre
>  * Effects of rating
>  * Effects of number of theaters
>2. Domestic box office only, or foreign as well? _Separate bar charts_, year over year each.
>3. Who are the major studios, and can Microsoft compete? _Pie chart_
>4. Of profitable movies, what is the relationship of budget?  How many were profitable?
